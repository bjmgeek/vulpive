Here are the steps to set up Vulpive on your webserver:

0)  You must have MySQL and PHP on your server.  Newer versions ideally, but I doubt the code uses any features that have been added in the past 3 years.

1)  Create a MySQL database called 'vulpive'.  Give at least one user full read/write access to it.

2)  Import vulpive.sql into the database.  You might do this with a client like phpMyAdmin, or by the following command on Linux:
	mysql -u [user] -p vulpive < vulpive.sql

3)  Upload everything to your webserver, if you haven't yet.

4)  In includes.php, replace:
	mysql_connect("localhost","root",null);
	
    with:
	mysql_connect("localhost","[your database username]","[your database password]");

5)  Customize your style:
	- If you need to add any javascript or meta tags, do so it the 'SITE-SPECIFIC HEAD DATA' area of header.php
	- If you want to add a banner to your comic page, add it in the 'SITE-SPECIFIC HEADER' area of header.php
	- To add links to other parts of your site, replace the text '[Links and stuff go here]' in links.php
	- If you want a custom footer, add it in the 'SITE-SPECIFIC FOOTER' area of footer.php
	- Modify default.css to set the look and feel of your comic page.
	- You can overwrite images/favicon.ico with a 16x16 png image related to your comic.  (Still give it the name 'favicon.ico', though.)
	- Make changes in includes.php if you want:
		* Change the definitions of FIRST, PREVIOUS, NEXT, LAST, MONTH_BACK, MONTH_FORWARD to whatever HTML you want to represent the various navigation links.
		* Change "THUMB_WIDTH" if you want your thumbnails to be more or less than 150px wide.

6)  Make sure PHP has write access to the 'images' folder.

7)  Bring up index.php or upload.php in your web browser.  (index.php will redirect you to upload.php)

8)  index.php will continue redirecting you to upload.php until there is at least one comic to display.  If you want to stop this behaviour, upload a comic for today's date or earlier, and make sure it is set to be 'visible'.

9)  Go to 'Change settings' in the sidebar to specify further layout settings for your comic strip.

10)  You should be good to go.  If you ever get stuck, be sure to use the tooltips.  If you ever get really stuck, file a bug at http://sourceforge.net/projects/vulpive, or harass the developer at pifactorial@gmail.com.
